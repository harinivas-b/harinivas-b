# HARINIVAS B — THE SERIES

A cinematic, streaming-inspired portfolio for **Harinivas B**: ECE Student, Aspiring Analog IC Design, and Student Entrepreneur.
Every section is an episode, every project is an Original, and the whole site plays like a series.

## Run it locally

Requires **Node.js 18+**.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The static site is written to `dist/` and can be deployed as-is to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages or any static host.

## Updating the content

**All content lives in one file: [`src/data/portfolio.ts`](src/data/portfolio.ts).**

| To change… | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Name, intro, email, LinkedIn, GitHub | `profile` |
| A project, or a new one | `projects` (add an object; it appears in Originals, the overlay, the resume sheet and the counts) |
| Achievements / certifications | `achievements`, `certifications` |
| Skills and their "where it's used" notes | `skillCategories`, `skillEvidence` |
| Seasons and episodes (My Journey) | `seasons` |
| Top 10 row | `topPicks` |
| ▶ Play Intro highlight reel | `introSlides` |
| Profile order (Recruiter / Developer / Creative) | `viewerProfiles` |
| Opening studio card text | `profile.originalLabel` |

**Resume:** replace `public/assets/Harinivas_B_Resume.pdf` and update `resumePdf` in `portfolio.ts`.

**Photo:** replace `public/assets/profile.jpg`.
